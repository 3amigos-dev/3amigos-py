Documentation for 3Amigos Python GitHub Template!
================================================================

A GitHub Template Repository Generated via cookiecutter from
`3amigos-py cookiecutter <https://github.com/3amigos-dev/cookiecutter-3amigos-py>`_
it can be used via the GitHub template. It would be worth looking at the
cookiecutter repository. It is a little more complicated but it will provide a
better outcome, see that repository for more details.

What 3amigos-py Provides
========================

3amigos-py is designed around providing a starting template to work on a
python library or application with integration into lots of open source CI
pipelines with static code analysis and build checks to ensure a minimum level
of testing coverage. It starts with a minimum of 100% coverage but this can be
lowered to suit the needs of the application.

CI Container Technique
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Follow `3Amigos <https//3amigos-dev.github.io/>`_ to use CI container pattern.


Open Source CI Pipelines Supported
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Use an `Azure Pipelines <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/devops/pipelines/>`_ CI.


Extras
~~~~~~

- Use `pyspelling <https://github.com/facelessuser/pyspelling>`_ to check spelling in CI.
- Use `flake8 <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8>`_ for static code analysis.
- Use `bandit <https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit>`_ for security static analysis. 
- Use `pylint <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint>`_ for static code analysis.
- Use `isort <https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort>`_ for sorting imports.
